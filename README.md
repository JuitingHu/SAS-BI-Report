# SAS-BI-Report

Business Case：
You are the manager of the business intelligence department at Insight Toys Corporation, one of the world’s largest toy manufacturers with operations across the globe. Few weeks ago, the company appointed a new Marketing VP, and in a recent presentation he announced a new strategy for some of the best-selling toy products. He asked you for help in developing a case study (a visual story line) that will help the executive team for better and faster understanding of the presented information. In his keynote, he wants to go over some facts about current business performance and then use that data to make the case for a new strategy. The manager is not sure what type of data/numbers he will ultimately be using in his presentation, and therefore, he asked you to make the business report as flexible as possible in order to allow for further explorations, e.g., filtering, slicing and dicing.

Based on this business case, I created a business intelligence report by using SAS Report Designer.
