# SAS BI Report

The lecturer of SAS for business intelligence asks us to create a business intelligence report based on the business case by using SAS Report Designer. 

The following is business case info:
You are the manager of the business intelligence department at Insight Toys Corporation, one of the world’s largest toy manufacturers with operations across the globe. Few weeks ago, the company appointed a new Marketing VP, and in a recent presentation, he announced a new strategy for some of **the best-selling toy products**. He asked you for help in developing a case study (a visual storyline) that will help the executive team for better and faster understanding of the presented information. In his keynote, he wants to go over some **facts about current business performance** and then use that data to make the case for a new strategy. The manager is not sure what type of data/numbers he will ultimately be used in his presentation, and therefore, he asked you to make the business report as flexible as possible in order to allow for further explorations, e.g., **filtering, slicing and dicing**. 

The BI report I created with 4 sections</br>
• Product Performance: This section mainly analysis the product performance to indicate some of the best-selling products and help to develop the strategy.</br>
</br> 
• Area Performance: As a multinational corporation around the world, this section mainly analysis each area performance.</br> 
</br>
• Revenue Performance: This section mainly analysis the revenue performance of Insight Toy Company in 2017 to evaluate a company's    financial health.</br> 
</br>
• Customer Management: This section mainly analysis customer satisfaction by different factors in order to manage and understand the customers.</br>
 
Recently, I am trying to learn more about SAS Base Programming part by myself.
